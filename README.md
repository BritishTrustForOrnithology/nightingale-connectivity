# ANALYSIS OF NIGHTINGALE MIGRATORY CONNECTIVITY IN R

We used a combination of Google Earth Engine and R to perform large-scale extraction, manipulation, and analysis of data on wildfires in Polesia. We use a mixture of data sources, including our own geolocator and GPS data, and other data obtained through the Earth Engine catalogue, citizen science programs such as eBird, and other studies, refered in our paper.
